# Angular2-Polymer

`angular2-polymer` is a directive factory that aims at bridging the gaps between using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) based Web Components in [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) applications.

```typescript
import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, Component } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { PolymerElement } from '@vaadin/angular2-polymer';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    PolymerElement('paper-input'),
    PolymerElement('vaadin-combo-box')
  ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
  schemas: [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ]
})
export class AppModule { }

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component',
  template: `
    <paper-input [(value)]="myValue"></paper-input>
    <vaadin-combo-box [(value)]="myValue" [items]="myItems"></vaadin-combo-box>
  `
})
class AppComponent {
  myValue = 'A';
  myItems = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
}
```
