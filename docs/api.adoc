Native Angular 2 directive for Polymer.

[[vaadin-angular2-polymer.api.introduction]]
== Introduction

This module consists of one generic Angular 2 directives factory method named [classname]#PolymerElement#, which is able to handle any Polymer element for easy integrating on Angular apps.

== Features

The [classname]#PolymerElement# is composed of a set of low level directives which would be added to the component dynamically.

`changeEventsAdapterDirective`::
This directive configures all the public [propertyname]#property#, that notify for their value change in a Polymer element, to be an Angular 2 link:https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/core/DirectiveMetadata-class.html#!#outputs-anchor[output].
So as any change made in a property in the polymer side, will be propagated to the Angular 2 parent component.

`notifyForDiffersDirective`::
Configures all the public [propertyname]#properties# in a Polymer element to be an Angular 2 link:https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/core/DirectiveMetadata-class.html#!#inputs-anchor[input].
It allows to notify changes from the Angular side to Polymer. It supports primitive types, as well as both Array and Object properties, but not it's children.
If you want to notify nested object changes, you can still do it by calling the Polymer's [methodname]#notifyPath# method on the element.

`formElementDirective`::
If the element has the Polymer Form Element Behavior, this directive is added to the component, and it configures the element to be compatible with the Angular 2 `ngForm`.

`validationDirective`::
It is another directive added in the case of the element has the Polymer Form Element Behavior. It sets the Polymer [propertyname]#invalid# flag based on the Angular 2 `ngControl` state.

`reloadConfigurationDirective`::
This directive is added to those Polymer elements that need to run a configuration function after they are initialized.
It is added to all those Polymer elements having the [methodname]#isInitialized# and [methodname]#reloadConfiguration# methods in their prototype.

== Usage

In order to use the [classname]#PolymerElement# in the [propertyname]#directives# block of your [classname]#Component#, you have to import it as is shown in the example below.

The only public API is the [classname]#PolymerElement(tagName: string): Array<Directive># factory method.
The argument [propertyname]#tagName# is mandatory, and must match the tag name of the Polymer element.
The factory returns the set of necessary directives for the given Polymer element.
Hence, you have to add the [classname]#PolymerElement# directive as many times as different Polymer elements you are using in your Angular 2 component.
